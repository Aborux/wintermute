Wintermute Core Application (WntrCore)
---------------------------

1. Introduction

This module represents the central application that is the skeletal glue
of Wintermute. It binds all of the sub-components into one huge big blob
of awesome :).

2. About Wintermute

Wintermute, in short, is designed to a flexible, autonomous and
adaptive application framework that would learn about any and every aspect of
your life on a computer. Its primary goal is to become your personal life
assistant from responding to e-mails, checking social networks to
developing documents and rendering tasks on the computer as if you've done
it yourself. Wintermute, with the help of computer vision, voice recognition
and other human interface utilities (HIUs), attempts to implement a
superbly natural language interface (NLUI) to the end-user. The ideas and
inspiration of Wintermute are all due to the thinking and speculations of Dante
 Ashton <dante.ashton@thesii.org>, CPU/CEO of the Synthetic Intellect Institute.

3. Running Wintermute

Wintermute may be already bundled up for your operating system distribution.
Please visit <http://www.thesii.org/wiki/Wintermute#Download> to see if your
system is currently supported. Otherwise, see the INSTALL file for information
about building Wintermute on your system.

4. Plug-ins and Language Bindings

We've currently added the ability to integrate and build plug-ins into
Wintermute's core libraries. We're working on adding support for other language
support to amplify the capabilities of Wintermute and its range of developers.
Right now, the core APIs are available and ready for extenstion. Refer to
current bindings for the APIs for more information.

5. Documentation

Practically all of the documentation that's done for Wintermute is stored
  on-line at <http://www.thesii.org/wiki>. Feel free to not only search that
site, but also enter our IRC channel (#sii or #sii-dev, both on
FreeNode) to ask questions about Wintermute and how you can assist. Check out

# Wintermute

=========================

An artificial intelligence agent for the Linux desktop.

****

## Abstract

This repository contains the source code and information to required to build
the core instance that harbors each extension and form of Wintermute on desktop
machines.

## About Wintermute

Wintermute, in short, is designed to a flexible, autonomous and
adaptive application framework that would learn about any and every aspect of
your life on a computer. Its primary goal is to become your personal life
assistant from responding to e-mails, checking social networks to
developing documents and rendering tasks on the computer as if you've done
it yourself. Wintermute, with the help of computer vision, voice recognition
and other human interface utilities (HIUs), attempts to implement a
superbly natural language interface (NLUI) to the end-user. The ideas and
inspiration of Wintermute are all due to the thinking and speculations of Dante
Ashton <dante.ashton@thesii.org>, CPU/CEO of the Synthetic Intellect Institute.

## Running Wintermute

Wintermute may be already bundled up for your operating system distribution.
Please visit the (Packages)[https://github.com/thesii.org/wiki/Downloads#Distributions]
to see if your system is currently supported. Otherwise, see the `INSTALL` file for
information about building Wintermute on your system.

## Plug-ins and Language Bindings

We've currently added the ability to integrate and build plug-ins into
Wintermute's core libraries. We're working on adding support for other language
support to amplify the capabilities of Wintermute and its range of developers.
Right now, the core APIs are available and ready for extenstion. Refer to
current bindings for the APIs for more information.

## Documentation

Practically all of the documentation that's done for Wintermute is stored
on-line at (GitHub)[https://github.com/thesii/wintermute/wiki]. Feel free 
to not only search the Wiki, but also enter our IRC channel (`#sii` or `#sii-dev`
, both on FreeNode) to ask questions about Wintermute and how you can assist. Check out
the [Contribs page](https://github.thesii/wintermute/wiki/Contributing).

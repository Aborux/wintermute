Wintermute is an extensible application that aims to become the foundation of 
an **artificial intelligence framework**. The application is written in C++ at 
its core.

## Installing

Installing? **Easy**. We use [CMake](http://cmake.org); we gotcha. But read
INSTALL.md for more information.

## Tested Operating Systems
So far, Wintermute has only been built and tested on **[Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.com)** running 
a developer preview of Raring Ringtail. It's recommended that after building, you run the test sute (`make test`) and have
your test results be uploaded to CDash. Wintermute is also tested on [Travis.CI](https://travis-ci.org/thesii/wintermute) for
those who prefer that utility.

Wintermute Core Module
---------------------------

1. Introduction

This module represents the central application 
that is the skeletal glue of Wintermute. It binds
all of the sub-components into one huge big blob of
awesome :). Please refer to INSTALL for more
information about building and installing Wintermute.

2. About Wintermute

Wintermute, in short, is designed to a flexible,
autonomous and adaptive application framework that'll
learn about any and every aspect of your life on a
computer. It's primary goal is to become your personal
life assistant from responding to e-mails, checking social
networks to developing documents and rendering tasks on the
computer as if you've done it yourself. Wintermute, with
the help of computer vision, voice recognition and other
human interface utilities (HIUs), attempts to implement
a superbly natural language interface (NLUI) to the end-user.

3. Running Wintermute

For those interested in running or just testing Wintermute,
please refer to the INSTALL document for more information.

4. Documentation

Practically all of the documentation that's done for Wintermute
is stored online at http://www.thesii.org/wiki. Feel free to not
only search that site, but also enter our IRC channel (##sii-general
or ##sii-dev) to ask questions about Wintermute and how you can assist.

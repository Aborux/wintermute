2. About Wintermute

Wintermute, in short, is designed to a flexible,
autonomous and adaptive application framework that will
learn about any and every aspects of your life on a
computer. It's primary goal is to become your personal
life assistant from responding to e-mails, checking social
networks to developing documents and rendering tasks on the
computer as if you've done it yourself. Wintermute, with
the help of computer vision, voice recognition and other
human interface utilities (HIUs), attempts to implement
a superbly natural language interface (NLUI) to the end-user.

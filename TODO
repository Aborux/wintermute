# ToDos and Need-To-Finish's.

This document provides a list of things to be done and checked off by the team
in a collaborative manner.

***

* Have WINTERMUTE_VERSION be populated with a commitsh from Git (up to 10 characters) [0.1-devXXXXXXXX]
 - Could do the same for Bazaar and Subversion if one can do it in CMake.
* Create Doxygen tag files so sub-projects related to Wintermute can cross reference.
* Drop Boost::ProgramOptions and implement a more flexible command-line parsing system. -- CHECK (jalcine)
* Provide more of a unified building experience with CMake.
 * Implement UseWintermute.cmake
 * Implement FindWintermute.cmake
  * Allow discovery of 'wintermute' executable.
  * Allow detection of already installed plug-ins using find_package()
    - Should allow plug-ins to resolve build dependencies.
* Decouple the use of QApplication and make Wintermute not rely on X.

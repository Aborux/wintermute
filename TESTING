# Testing Wintermute

As a new shift, (test driven development)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development] is one of the
biggest practices we try to follow here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, and as such, in the Wintermute
project. We recommend that before you attempt to define a feature or expectation to write out a test for it
and then build code that ensures the test and the rest of the test suite passes.

## Testing Framework
Being that Wintermute uses Qt throughout its code, we use Qt's testing tools in our suite.
All of the tests can be invoked by running `make test` from the top-level directory.

It binds all of the sub-components into one huge big blob\r\nof awesome :).\r\n\r\n## About Wintermute\r\n\r\nWintermute, in short, is designed to a flexible, autonomous and\r\nadaptive application framework that would learn about any and every aspect of\r\nyour life on a computer. Its primary goal is to become your personal life\r\nassistant from responding to e-mails, checking social networks to\r\ndeveloping documents and rendering tasks on the computer as if you've done\r\nit yourself. Wintermute, with the help of computer vision, voice recognition\r\nand other human interface utilities (HIUs), attempts to implement a\r\nsuperbly natural language interface (NLUI) to the end-user. The ideas and\r\ninspiration of Wintermute are all due to the thinking and speculations of Dante\r\nAshton <dante.ashton@thesii.org>, CPU/CEO of the Synthetic Intellect Institute.\r\n\r\n## Running Wintermute\r\n\r\nWintermute may be already bundled up for your operating system distribution.\r\nPlease visit http://www.thesii.org/wiki/Wintermute#Download to see if your\r\nsystem is currently supported. Otherwise, see the INSTALL file for information\r\nabout building Wintermute on your system.\r\n\r\nPlug-ins and Language Bindings\r\n\r\nWe've currently added the ability to integrate and build plug-ins into\r\nWintermute's core libraries. We're working on adding support for other language\r\nsupport to amplify the capabilities of Wintermute and its range of developers.\r\nRight now, the core APIs are available and ready for extenstion. Refer to\r\ncurrent bindings for the APIs for more information.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nPractically all of the documentation that's done for Wintermute is stored\r\non-line at http://www.thesii.org/wiki. Feel free to not only search that\r\nsite, but also enter our IRC channel (#sii or #sii-dev, both on\r\nFreeNode) to ask questions about Wintermute and how you can assist. Check out\r\nhttp://www.thesii.org/wiki/Development.\r\n\r\n## Reporting and Contributing to the Cause\r\n\r\nWe here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers\r\nof Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible\r\nfor Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at contact@thesii.org or\r\nsend us a message to our mailing list at dev@thesii.org. We hope to\r\nhear (or see or read) from you soon.\r\n","google":""}

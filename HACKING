** Modifiy Wintermute::Initialize() to run and manage a subprocess that controls
the networking library of Wintermute, and another system that manages all of
the loaded plugins to Wintermute. Soon, when the more autonomous feature
is implemented; we may need to branch that off into a separate process (or have
the master process become that) and let it manage IPC more transparently.

Current needed IPC modules:
> wintermute --ipc=network
  : Used to manage the broadcasting and AngelNet components of Wintermute.

> wintermute --ipc=extensions
  : Used to manage Wintermute's extensibility from a separate application.
  : NOTE) This might be broken down even more, similar to how Chromium does
their project works.
  : "wintermute --ipc=extensions extension=330434-34324324-34342" could
represent a Wintermute
  : process, a sandbox of sorts that gives one extension the ability to run as
if it were a program,
  : but provide the require extensibility to Wintermute's core process.

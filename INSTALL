Wintermute Core
------------------------

1. Build Dependencies

In order to build Wintermute from scratch, you'll primarily need the following:

  * gcc (>= 4.4)
  * cmake (>= 2.8.3)
  * QtDbus (>= 4.7.3), QtCore (>= 4.7.3), QtGui (>= 4.7.3)
  * Boost::System
  * Boost::ProgramOptions

Be sure that you also have the **development** packages for each of these librar
ies. A simple shell command to install everything would be:

$ apt-get install cmake libqt-dev libboost-dev

After that's all done and completed; you should have a proper development enviro
nment (in terms of headers and libraries) for building.

2. Compiling

NOTE: We recommend that for bug reporting purposes that you stick to the
instructions given here for compiling. Deviation makes it that much more
difficult to pinpoint an issue with compilation. 

 - Create a directory called 'build' in the downloaded repository folder (in
   this case, 'core') and then enter in a terminal:

   $ mkdir -p core/build && cd core/build

 - Run 'CMake' and configure the variables for optimal build.

   NOTE: If you wish to debug Wintermute or provide debugging information, it's
         important that you set the CMake varible 'CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE' to either
         Debug or RelWithDebInfo, so that appropriate back-traces and memory
         dumps can be done.

   $ ccmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

 - Compile and then install as root (or locally, if you prefer).
	
   $ make
   # make install

3. Complete!

You have successfully installed Wintermute! Now, just run 'wintermute --help'
in a command window to investigate the currently available command line
options. Report any bugs, errors, glitches or miscalibrations to our development
team by leaving an open bug report on either <https://launchpad.net/~wintermute>
or <https://www.github.com/wntr/core>. Thank you for installing Wintermute; we
hope to hear from you shortly.

4. Sidenotes

Wintermute may report issues about missing GTK themes if you're running it unde
r a GNOME desktop. Installing the Qt Curve engine for GTK will hide this warning
on your system.

Also, if you installed from scratch in this manner; there's no real means of u
nistalling the program from your computer. If this is desired, run the followi
ng in a terminal window:

	# rm -rv /usr/include/wntr
	# rm -rv /usr/share/wintermute
	# rm -rv /usr/share/Wintermute /usr/share/Wntr*
	# rm -v /usr/bin/wintermute

Wintermute Core
------------------------

1. Build Dependencies

In order to build Wintermute from scratch, you'll primarily need the following:

  * gcc (>= 4.4)
  * cmake (>= 2.8.3)
  * QtDbus (>= 4.7.3), QtCore (>= 4.7.3), QtGui (>= 4.7.3)
  * Boost::System
  * Boost::ProgramOptions
  * PackageKit (for Qt)

Be sure that you also have the **development** packages for each of these librar
ies. A simple shell command to install everything would be:

# apt-get install cmake-curses-gui cmake libqt4-dev libboost-dev libpackagekit-qt2-dev

After that's all done and completed; you should have a proper development environment
(in terms of headers and libraries) for building.

2. Compiling

NOTE: We recommend that for bug reporting purposes that you stick to the
instructions given here for compiling. Deviation makes it that much more
difficult to pinpoint an issue with compilation. If anything, use the provided
"configure.sh" script to build Wintermute's core.

 - Create a directory called 'build' in the downloaded repository folder (in
   this case, 'core') and then enter in a terminal:

   $ mkdir -p core/build
   $ cd core/build

 - Run 'CMake' and configure the variables for optimal build.

   NOTE: If you wish to debug Wintermute or provide debugging information, it's
         important that you set the CMake variable 'CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE' to either
         Debug or RelWithDebInfo, so that appropriate back-traces and memory
         dumps can be done.

   $ ccmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

 - Compile and then install as root (or locally, if you prefer).
	
   $ make
   # make install

3. Complete!

You have successfully installed Wintermute! Now, just run 'wintermute --help=all'
in a command window to investigate the currently available command line
options. Report any bugs, errors, glitches or mis-calibrations to our development
team by leaving an open bug report on <https://bugs.launchpad.net/wintermute>.
Thank you for installing Wintermute; we
hope to hear from you shortly.

4. Side-notes

Wintermute may report issues about missing GTK themes if you're running it under
on a GNOME desktop. Installing the Qt Curve engine for GTK will hide this warning
on your system.

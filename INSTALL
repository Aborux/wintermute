Installation
===========================

0. Requirements.

In order to install Wintermute on your system; it has to
have a few things in check first.

0.a Packages

For Ubuntu-based (or Debian-based) systems, you'll need the following
packages:

	* Boost (serialization, program_options, signals2, timer, thread, filesystem, date_time) >= 1.40
	* Qt (QtCore, QJson [ = 0.7 ], QtXml) >= 4
	* Soprano >= 0.7
	* pkg-config (to find Soprano via CMake)

We're a group that loves toolkits that make life easier so you'll see us using Boost and Qt
a lot.

0.b Compiling

We use the CMake build system for our compiling needs, so a quick:

# apt-get install cmake

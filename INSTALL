Wintermute Core
------------------------

1. Build Dependencies

In order to build Wintermute from scratch, you'll primarily need the following:

  * gcc (>= 4.4)
  * cmake (>= 2.8.3)
  * QtDbus (>= 4.7.3), QtCore (>= 4.7.3), QtGui (>= 4.7.3), QtNetwork (>= 4.7.3)
    QtXml (>= 4.7.3)
  * QJson
  * Boost::Python
  * Boost::System
  * Boost::ProgramOptions
  * Soprano

Wintermute's core only needs QtDbus, QtCore, QtGui, Boost::System and
Boost::ProgramOptions; the other libraries are included as some of the build
dependencies for the central libraries of Wintermute. You will also need to have
Wintermute's database (WntrData), Wintermute's network (WntrNtwk) and
linguistics (WntrLing) libraries installed with development files in your
system. See <http://www.github.com/wntr> for information about where to obtain
these bits of code. Alternatively, you can branch the latest working copy of
these libraries by running these commands in your terminal:

  $ git clone git@github.com:wntr/ntwk
  $ git clone git@github.com:wntr/data
  $ git clone git@github.com:wntr/ling

Ensure you build these libraries in this order:

  (WntrNtwk) or (WntrData)
  (WntrLing)

WntrLing relies on WntrData, so it's important that it's already built and
installed. Refer to the INSTALL document in each repository for more
information about building each library. 

2. Compiling

NOTE: We recommend that for bug reporting purposes that you stick to the
instructions given here for compiling. Deviation makes it that much more
difficult to pinpoint an issue with compilation. 

 - Create a directory called 'build' in the downloaded repository folder (in
   this case, 'core') and then enter it:

   $ mkdir -p core/build && cd core/build

 - Run 'CMake' and configure the variables for optimal build.

   NOTE: If you wish to debug Wintermute or provide debugging information, it's
         important that you set the CMake varible 'CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE' to either
         Debug or RelWithDebInfo, so that appropriate back-traces and memory
         dumps can be done.

   $ ccmake ..

 - Compile and then install as root (or locally, if you prefer).
	
   $ make
   # make install

3. Complete!

You have successfully installed Wintermute! Now, just run 'wintermute --help'
in a command window to investigate the currently available command line
options. Report any bugs, errors, glitches or miscalibrations to our development
team by leaving an open bug report on either <https://launchpad.net/~wintermute>
or <https://www.github.com/wntr/core>. Thank you for installing Wintermute; we
hope to hear from you shortly.
